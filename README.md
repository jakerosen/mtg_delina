# Delina / Pixie Guide combo in Magic: the Gathering

This is a probability simulator for the combo of Delina, Wild Mage and Pixie
Guide in Magic.  Delina has an ability that grants you a token of target
creature (Pixie Guide for the combo) and has a die roll for a 30% chance of a
reroll (granting another token).  Pixie Guide has an ability that gives you
another dice when you roll, taking the highest roll, so of course, copying it
increases your odds of rerolling.  What are the odds of this combo 'going
infinite'?
<br>

It turns out that with 1 Pixie Guide, the most likely case, you only have about
a 14% chance of 'going off'.  About 49% of the time, you only get 1 token
(complete fail), and the rest of the time, you usually get only 1 or 2 extra
tokens.<br>

With 2 Pixie Guides, you have about a 27% chance of going off, and about a 34%
chance of getting 1 token.  With 3 Pixie Guides, a very unlikely case, you have
about a 42% chance of going off, and about 25% chance of getting only 1
token.<br>

With this examination, we can see that this combo is not very reliable.
However, the investment to get Delina and 1 Pixie Guide is not very high, and
having a 14% chance to win on the spot is a reasonable upside to a fine card.
